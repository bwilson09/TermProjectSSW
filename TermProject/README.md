Project Structure:
	We began this project based on the specs in the first version of the project details, which did not
	include the actual database. As a result, our initial implementation did not account for the BowlingUser
	table or the division table. We also began the project well before the suggested controller structure
	and naming conventions were provided, so a lot of the controller names / property names etc differ from
	what was suggested later.
